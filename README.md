# IceCubeGame

### - Goal

Welcome to my first little project on github.
In this little game you are an ice cube which can move all around the screen with the arrow keys.
You have to avoid all the fire balls to not melt. 
The goal is to survive the biggest amount of time as possible, so you can't really win this game.

### - Technologies

For this project I am using python and the module pygame.
